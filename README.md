# employee-directory-react
This app utilizes react to create a dynamic front-end. It uses Axios NPM to read from a database of employees and creates a table showing the employees' image, name, phone, email, and date of birth. The user can then sort the table by these properties or search for a specific employee by any parameters. Since this app is made with react, the table will dynamically change with the user's search input.
